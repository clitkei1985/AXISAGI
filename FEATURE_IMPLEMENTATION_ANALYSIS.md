3. **Advanced reasoning and reflection systems**
4. **Complete offline functionality**
5. **Temporal awareness and world modeling**

## Conclusion

The AXIS AI system shows impressive progress with **75% of intended features** at least partially implemented. The core infrastructure (memory, chat, plugins, admin) is solid, but advanced AI capabilities and some specialized features need development. The immediate priority should be refactoring large files and completing the missing 25% of features to achieve the full vision.

The system is already functional and provides significant value, but achieving the complete feature set would make it a truly revolutionary AI assistant platform.
