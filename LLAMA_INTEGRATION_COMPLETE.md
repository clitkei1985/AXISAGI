## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Memory Integration Flow**:
```
User Input → Memory Search (k=5) → Prompt Enhancement → LLaMA Generation → 
Memory Storage → Response + Learning
```

### **Offline Operation**:
```
No OpenAI Key Detected → Auto-load LLaMA → 4-bit Quantization → 
GPU Optimization → Ready for Offline Intelligence
```

### **Research Pipeline**:
```
Query → Memory Search → Web Search → AI Synthesis → 
Follow-up Queries → Comprehensive Report → Memory Storage
```
